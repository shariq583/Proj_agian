          Weather Touches 5&deg;C In Karavhi!
        </h3>
        <p class="RW_Main_Article">
          As per details, the minimum mercury level dipped to 15.5°C, marking the onset of colder weather in the city.
          The cold air, originating from the western system that entered the country through Balochistan, is currently
          influencing the regions of Sindh and Balochistan.<br>

          Monday morning also witnessed reduced visibility due to fog in the city's atmosphere, with a recorded
          visibility of two kilometres.<br>

          As the western system continues to influence the weather patterns, meteorological experts anticipate
          stronger-than-normal winds persisting in Karachi on the following day.<br>
          Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had earlier forecasted the arrival of cold weather on December 18.<br>

          PMD Karachi Chief, Sardar Sarfraz, had assured that while temperatures are expected to drop further on
          Wednesday, the mercury is unlikely to plunge into single digits.<br>

          Meanwhile, the PMD has forecast mainly cold and dry weather for most plain areas of the country during the
          next 24 hours. However, very cold weather is expected in northern areas.<br>

          Fog/smog is likely to occur in upper Sindh, plain areas of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa during morning and
          night hours.<br>

          According to the synoptic, continental air was prevailing over most parts of the country. During the last 24
          hours, cold and dry weather prevailed over most parts of the country, while very cold and partly cloudy in
          northern parts.<br>

          The lowest minimum temperatures recorded were Leh -6°C, Skardu, Kalam, Astore, Gupis, Kalat -05°C, Gilgit
          -04°C, Quetta, Rawalakot, Hunza and Dir -03°C.<br>
